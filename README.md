### Hi there :vulcan_salute:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting myself to meet people and learn how to code. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be open minded about expectations.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I am an open book. 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I share a birthday with my son. 
- :weight_lifting_woman: In theory I like working out. 
- :nerd_face: Excited to start this journey into a new career path. 

I am unsure where this journey will take me, at the moment I am keeping an open mind on what path to take and what interests me. I come from a Newspaper background as my family owns one. I am interested in mental health, children and aim to be an advocate for domestic violence surviors and alienated parents.
