### Hi there :vulcan_salute:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on figuring out what language I enjoy learning.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HMTL, CSS and JavaScript.  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I share a birthday with my son. 
- :weight_lifting_woman: In theory I like working out. 
- :nerd_face: Excited to start this journey into a new career path. 

I am unsure where this journey will take me, at the moment I am keeping an open mind on what path to take and what interests me. I come from a newspaper background as my family owns one (The Hobart Democrat-Chief). I am interested in mental health, children and aim to be an advocate for domestic violence surviors and alienated parents.
